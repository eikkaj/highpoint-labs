I've been working for some time on this idea now and am happy to make it official that this is becoming a real thing.

## The concept

HighPoint Labs will be scaffolding and deploying a crowd-sourcing web application where users can report potable water sources and search for potable water sources.

Main features include:

- a content management system to store and index water sources reported by humans
- a fully open-sourced code base
- extensible and open APIs for folks to integrate with
- basic reporting mechanisms

### Why?

Access to water is a complicated matter and always has been. A huge percentage of the United States is considered to be in a water crisis. Around half a million of Americans are currently considered to be homeless. Obtaining water is only going to become more difficult.
